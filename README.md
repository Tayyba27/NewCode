# Introduction:
In this project, students will learn to program in Python. This project  is aimed at students who may, or may not, have any experience at all, but are beginners in Python. Students will learn the basics of how python works including: manipulation of strings, math operations, writing functions, and many more things. This class will be taught using Python 3. In addition, as a new feature, this class will have projects based on designing games and art using python. 

Note: Some aspects of this course were challenging to college s

# What is Python used for?
Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization. Since it’s relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organizing finances.

###  “Writing programs is a very creative and rewarding activity,”

What can you do with python? Some things include:

Data analysis and machine learning

Web development

Automation or scripting

Software testing and prototyping

Everyday tasks


Why is Python so popular?
Python is popular for a number of reasons. Here’s a deeper look at what makes it so versatile and easy to use for coders.

It has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, so it’s easier to read and understand. This makes it quicker to build projects, and faster to improve on them.

It’s versatile. Python can be used for many different tasks, from web development to machine learning.

It’s beginner friendly, making it popular for entry-level coders.

It’s open source, which means it’s free to use and distribute, even for commercial purposes.

Python’s archive of modules and libraries—bundles of code that third-party users have created to expand Python’s capabilities—is vast and growing.
